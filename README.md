# Rwa-blogs
> This is a web app that provides the opportunity for people who are passionate about reading and writing articles. People can create blogs and others can be able to visit and read them. In addition, they can like and add comments on these posts. It is built with Rails. It is also furnished with user management using the devise gem and api integration interface to enable developers plug in easily and use with different front-ends. there is also authentication during user sign in and out processeses. I also added the authorization process to limit services depending on the roles of users.
